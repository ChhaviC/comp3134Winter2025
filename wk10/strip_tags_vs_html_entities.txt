strip_tags() removes all HTML tags from a string.
- Example: "<b>Hello</b>" becomes "Hello"
- Effective for basic sanitization but not ideal for preserving formatting.

htmlentities() encodes characters into HTML entities.
- Example: "<script>" becomes "&lt;script&gt;"
- This is better for displaying input safely without removing it.

htmlentities is preferred when user input may contain special characters or symbols but should not be interpreted as code.
