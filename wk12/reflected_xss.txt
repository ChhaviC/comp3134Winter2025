This file demonstrates a reflected XSS vulnerability.

By injecting `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into the URL, the application reflects it back without filtering.

The browser executes the script, showing a pop-up.

This can be used to trick users into clicking malicious links, leading to session hijacking or redirection attacks.
