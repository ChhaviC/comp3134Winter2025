To mitigate the Stored XSS vulnerability, I applied htmlentities() when displaying the stored comment.

This converts special characters like < and > into safe HTML entities (&lt;, &gt;), which makes the browser show them as text instead of running them as code.

The script submitted via the form is still stored in comments.txt, but it no longer gets executed.

This protects users from persistent attacks and improves application security.
