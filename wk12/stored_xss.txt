This demonstrates a Stored XSS attack.

A script is submitted through a form and saved in comments.txt.

When the page is loaded, the script is retrieved and rendered directly into the page without sanitization.

As a result, the JavaScript executes automatically for every user who visits the page.

This can be used to steal cookies, log keystrokes, or redirect users.
